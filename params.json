{"name":"ZFSmanager","tagline":"ZFS administration tool for Webmin","body":"## ZFS administration tool for Webmin\r\n\r\nThis is in very early development, it is largely untested and should be avoided in production environments. That being said, try this out in a virtual machine or anywhere else where data is non-critical. My hope is that this will ultimately provide Webmin with similar ZFS functionality to FreeNAS and NAS4Free.\r\n\r\nI am brand new to Perl and Webminâ€™s API. so first I apologize for the shabby state the code is in, second any further contributions are greatly welcomed. I am learning a fair amount about ZFS along the way as well.\r\n\r\nI am currently developing this under ZFS on Linux in Centos 6.5, but all varients of ZFS/Webmin are planned to be supported in the future.\r\n\r\nTo install, grab a [release from github](https://github.com/jonmatifa/zfsmanager/releases), or repackage the current master as a tar and upload that to Webmin.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
