ZFS administration tool for Webmin

This is in *very* early development, be a good sysadmin and avoid untested/untrusted software in production environments.  That being said, try this out in a virtual machine or anywhere else where data is non-critical.  My hope is that this will provide Webmin with ZFS functionality similar to FreeNAS and NAS4Free.
